Consider a Hobby and how you could create an app around it. Examples:\n    - [Health and Fitness](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/01_Spring_2016/02_Health_Fitness)\n    - [Draft Kings](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/01_Spring_2016/01_Draft_Kings)\n2. Consider some work your are currently doing in school and create an app around that. Examples\n    - [Migration](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/02_Fall_2016/04_Migration)\n    - [Emulator](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/01_Spring_2016/06_Emulator)\n    - [Associations](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/01_Spring_2016/05_Associations)\n3. Consider an App you might find that would help people with something. Examples:\n    - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/01_Spring_2016/04_Linear_Regression)\n    - [Flight Information](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/02_Fall_2016/06_Flight_Info)\n    - [Libraries](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/02_Fall_2016/01_Libraries)\n4. Consider an app that might revolve around current events of politics. Examples:\n    - [Twitter Sentiment](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/02_Fall_2016/05_Twitter_Sentiment)\n    - [Counties](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects/tree/master/02_Fall_2016/03_Counties)\n5. Consider an app from the shiny directory and try to build upon or expand this in your own unique way. ***Note in this method you cannot just copy the code from the shiny page.***",
