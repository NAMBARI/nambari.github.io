We need to take the code and the skills we have and put them to use for an audience that does not have the same skills. \n\n## Project Guidelines\n\n### Individual Aspect\n\n1. Go to the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) website.\n    - Explore the [gallery](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) of Project ideas. \n    - Follow the [Tutorial](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/)\n    - Go through this [Walkthrough by Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/)\n    - To show you have done this, create a simple app that takes a standard normal statistic and displays the probability of achieving that value or greater in a standard normal distribution. In other words it takes a \\(z\\) value and gives a p-value. \n\n    \n### Group Aspect\n\n2. As a group your first task will be to come up with an idea for a Shiny app and to write the code for this. In order to facilitate this more I will provide some structure. \n    - Your app must allow a researcher to use their own inputs. \n    - Your app must display some type of interactive user interface aspects. \n        - For example - [Normal Calculator](https://www.sullivanstatistics.com/shiny/normcalc/): In this app I created depending on where the researcher wants to shade the normal distribution different boxes will pop up after the researcher makes a choice. \n    - You app must display graphical as well as statistical output. \n    - Your app must not be created copying code from an example app that is out there.\n        - We want to make sure you are not plagerizing. In the Normal Calculator app I provided, it appears similar to the DistCalc app from the shiny gallery, however the code behind it comes from my own code and graphing work that I have done in the past. None was copied or pasted from another Shiny app.\n    - Your app must function properly and be useful. \n    - Your app must run quickly and not be bulky.\n    - Your app should be easy to use or contain detailed instructions.\n3. Go through all of the [past Shiny Apps created in PHP 2560](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects)\n    - Go into the code and download all of the necessary packages to make them run. \n    - Run them using the commands in the README.md file of the repository. \n    - Write a one paragraph critique of the app.\n        - Was it easy to use?\n        - Was it fast to use?\n        - How was the look and feel of it. \n\n## Dates of Importance\n\n\n\n1. 04/17/2016 \n    - During this week you will be learning how to write a shiny app.\n    - Your calculator must be in a single file format.\n    - Must be done individually.\n    - Turn in Critiques of other groups work (group assignment)\n2. 04/24/2017 \n    - Form a group of 3-4 people and have an idea of what kind of app you want to create by this date.  \n    - Provide me with an explanation of:\n    - What your app will do?\n    - How do you see it being used?\n    - What types of options might you try to included for the user.\n    - If you are struggling with ideas [check this out](/ideas)\n    - [Project Starter Code](https://classroom.github.com/group-assignment-invitations/b77f48fc4b1da879109937becd702531)\n3. 05/02/2017-05/03/2017 \n    - We will spend 2 classes this week working on your app\n    - Bring a rough copy of your app to class.\n    - We will critique apps as a class.\n4. 05/09/2017\n    - We will take this last class to explore the apps together.\n    - Each group will briefly discuss their app and show how to use it.\n    - Presentations must be concise and display usage of the app.\n5. 05/16/2017 \n    - Final App due to me.\n    - You must have your final app in either a 1 or 2 file format.\n    - Provide an explanation of how it is to be used and discussing the creation of it.\n    - Detail the parts of the app you did individually.\n    - Submit form on grading your group members work and contribution to the project.\n \n\n## Rubric For Project\n\nGrade Category | Points\n-------------- | ------------\nTutorial/ Simple App | 20 \nApp Idea and Explanation | 10 \nApp and Presentation | 60\nGroup Evaluations | 10\n",
